Consequently, the length of the portion of the reference configuration, which is currently located between the supports, depends on the loading and therefore is not known in advance. In the present paper, the problem of a slender beam under a uniformly distributed force is investigated, which is clamped at one side but may slide through another clamping device in axial direction at the opposite side. In combination with a suitable coordinate transformation by which the numerical treatment is simplified, a finite element approach is utilized to determine the equilibrium shape for the maximum critical load that can be imposed on the beam. In the course of this, the influence of the extensibility of the beam axis is studied. A theory based on Reissner’s geometrically exact relations for the plane deformation of beams is adapted such that it allows constitutive relations on stress–strain level to be integrated consistently. In addition to the classical equations of the extensible elastica, a constitutive model derived from the St. Venant–Kirchhoff material of non-linear continuum mechanics is studied. The results obtained in this survey are finally compared to those from the linear beam theory, which turns out to be incapable of describing the problem under consideration in a satisfactory manner."

  abstract = {The interaction of beam-like structures against surfaces is a challenging problem with applications in engineering (wheel–rail contact, pipeline–soil interaction, ropes sliding on the seabed) and in medical applications such as surgical planning and training (catheter navigation, aneurysm coiling, stent deployment). This contact problem is traditionally solved using Total Lagrangian beam formulations, which interact against Lagrangian triangulated surfaces. Overall, the computational speed is affected, due to the nonlinearities of the beam formulation and, as well as due to the expensive search algorithms, required to find the close point projection. In the search towards an efficient beam to surface contact algorithm, this paper explores the combined use of (1) a corotational beam formulation, where the motion of the beam element is decomposed in rigid body and pure deformational parts and (2) an implicit description of the surface by means of discrete signed distance fields (SDF), which can be seen as a Lagrangian beam immersed within an Eulerian (rigid) solid. To do so, a previously reported implicit corotational formulation for beam dynamics is modified to account for frictional contact, by means of a penalty term. The new contributions are fully linearized to update the tangent operator and the system is integrated in time by means of the HHT-α method. Overall, a consistent implicit contact dynamics formulation is provided. A SDF, defined in a voxel-type grid, is used to represent implicitly the surface geometry. The SDF values and derivatives are computed at the Lagrangian point of integration of the beam by means of an efficient tensor product of compact, high order, 1D Kernels, as widely used in immersed Fluid–Structure Interaction techniques. A wide variety of validation tests are presented which prove the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {There is a class of planar 1D-continua which can be described exclusively by their placement functions which in turn are curves in a two-dimensional space.  In contrast to the Elastica for which the deformation energy depends on the projection of the second gradient to the normal vector of the placement function, i.e. the material curvature, the proposed continuum does also depend on the projection onto the tangent vector, introduced as the stretch gradient.  Thus, the deformation energy takes into account the complete second gradient of the placement function. In such a model, non-standard boundary conditions and more generalized forces such as double forces do appear. The deformation energy of the continuum is obtained by applying a heuristic homogenization procedure to a family of slender discrete pantographic structures constituted by extensional and rotational springs. Within the homogenization process, the overall length of the system is kept fixed, the number of the periodically appearing sub-systems, called cells, is increased, and the stiffnesses are appropriately scaled. For two examples, we numerically compare the family of discrete systems with the continuum. The analysis shows that the continuum represents the behaviour of the discrete system already for a relatively moderate number of cells. In particular, the behaviour of the deformation energy error between the discrete and the continuum models when the number of cells tends to infinity is determined by the homogenization process.},

  abstract = {Soft robotics is a challenging and promising branch of robotics. It can drive significant improvements across various fields of traditional robotics, and contribute solutions to basic problems such as locomotion and manipulation in unstructured environments. A challenging task for soft robotics is to build and control soft robots able to exert effective forces. In recent years, biology has inspired several solutions to such complex problems. This study aims at investigating the smart solution that the Octopus vulgaris adopts to perform a crawling movement, with the same limbs used for grasping and manipulation. An ad hoc robot was designed and built taking as a reference a biological hypothesis on crawling. A silicone arm with cables embedded to replicate the functionality of the arm muscles of the octopus was built. This novel arm is capable of pushing-based locomotion and object grasping, mimicking the movements that octopuses adopt when crawling. The results support the biological observations and clearly show a suitable way to build a more complex soft robot that, with minimum control, can perform diverse tasks.},

Moreover, we devise a set of benchmark systems, which can be used to validate numerical schemes for mechanical systems with frictional contacts. Finally, this set of benchmarks is used to numerically assert the properties striven for during the derivation of the presented scheme. Specifically, we show that the presented scheme can reproduce the dynamics of the frictional contact adequately and no numerical penetration of the contacting bodies arises—a big issue for most popular time-stepping schemes such as the one of Moreau. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presented scheme performs well for multibody systems containing flexible parts and that it allows general parametrizations such as the use of unit quaternions for the rotation of rigid bodies.},

In many engineering applications, such systems are composed of rigid and flexible bodies, which are interconnected by joints and can come into contact with each other or their surroundings. Prominent examples are automotive, wind turbine, and robotic systems. It is known from structural mechanics applications, that generalized-alpha schemes perform well for flexible multibody systems without contacts. This motivated the development of nonsmooth generalized-alpha methods for the simulation of mechanical systems with frictional contacts [2, 3, 5]. Typically, the Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler approach is used to stabilize the unilateral constraint, such that numerical penetration of the contact bodies can be avoided - a big issue of the most popular time-stepping schemes such as Moreau's scheme. The nonsmooth generalized-alpha method presented in this paper is derived in [2] and in contrast to [3,5] accounts for set-valued Coulomb-type friction on both velocity and acceleration level. Finally, we validate the method using a guided flexible hopper as a benchmark mechanical system.},

Quaternions over dual numbers are an established alternative representation; however, their use presents certain challenges: the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm contain a zero-angle singularity, and many common operations are less efficient using dual quaternions than with matrices. We present a new derivation of the dual quaternion exponential and logarithm that removes the singularity, and we show an implicit representation of dual quaternions offers analytical and empirical efficiency advantages compared to both matrices and explicit dual quaternions. Analytically, implicit dual quaternions are more compact and require fewer arithmetic instructions for common operations, including chaining and exponentials. Empirically, we demonstrate a 25{\%}--40{\%} speedup to compute the forward kinematics of multiple robots. This work offers a practical connection between dual quaternions and modern exponential coordinates, demonstrating that a quaternion-based approach provides a more efficient alternative to matrices for robot kinematics.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose some basic approaches towards a unification of the theories for deformable and rigid bodies. This unification process is based on two fundamental mechanical concepts, which are the principle of virtual work and the principle of d’Alembert-Lagrange. The basic idea is to initially look upon structural elements as general continua, and to endow them later with specific properties like rigidity, imposed by perfect bilateral constraints. It is shown by the example of a simple flexible multibody system how this unifying and systematic approach has to be carried out. The system under consideration consists of a rigid disk and a nonlinear elastic string, which may come into contact with each other. The contact is modeled as a hard unilateral geometric constraint combined with a one-dimensional Coulomb friction element. The contact interactions are formulated as set-valued force laws and impact laws, and the system is consequently treated within the framework of nonsmooth dynamics. The model of the string allows for large deformations in time and for a nonlinear elastic material response. By constraining the kinematics of the string to finite dimensions, a nonlinear finite element formulation is achieved in a very natural way.},

The new beam finite element exhibits drastically improved numerical performance when compared with the previously developed director-based formulations. This improvement is accomplished by adjusting the underlying variational beam formulation to the specific features of the director interpolation. In particular, the present approach does not rely on the assumption of an orthonormal director frame. The excellent performance of the new approach is illustrated with representative numerical examples. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract Within a variational formulation of continuum mechanics, as proposed for instance by Germain [1], the internal virtual work contribution of a continuum is postulated as a smooth density integrated over the deformed configuration of the body. In this smooth density the stress field appears as dual quantity to the gradient of the virtual displacement field. Since the mathematical definition of the volume integral naturally provides a macro-micro relation between infinitesimal volume elements and the continuous body, we propose in this paper an alternative definition of stress on the micro level of the infinitesimal volume elements. In particular, the stress is defined as the internal forces of the body that model the mutual force interaction between neighboring volume elements. The existence of the stress tensor on the macro level is then obtained from the summation of all virtual work contributions within the body, followed by a limit process in which the volume elements are sent to zero.

  abstract = {In this paper, we systematically investigate passive gaits that emerge from the natural mechanical dynamics of a bipedal system. We use an energetically conservative model of a simple spring-leg biped that exhibits well-defined swing leg dynamics. Through a targeted continuation of periodic motions of this model, we systematically identify different gaits that emerge from simple bouncing in place. We show that these gaits arise along one-dimensional manifolds that bifurcate into different branches with distinctly different motions. The branching is associated with repeated breaks in symmetry of the motion. Among others, the resulting passive dynamic gaits include walking, running, hopping, skipping and galloping. Our work establishes that the most common bipedal gaits can be obtained as different oscillatory motions (or nonlinear modes) of a single mechanical system with a single set of parameter values. For each of these gaits, the timing of swing leg motion and vertical motion is matched. This work thus supports the notion that different gaits are primarily a manifestation of the underlying natural mechanical dynamics of a legged system. Our results might explain the prevalence of certain gaits in nature, and may provide a blueprint for the design and control of energetically economical legged robots.},

  abstract = {Abstract The 20th century's robotic systems have been made from stiff materials, and much of the developments have pursued ever more accurate and dynamic robots, which thrive in industrial automation, and will probably continue to do so for decades to come. However, the 21st century's robotic legacy may very well become that of soft robots. This emerging domain is characterized by continuous soft structures that simultaneously fulfill the role of robotic link and actuator, where prime focus is on design and fabrication of robotic hardware instead of software control. These robots are anticipated to take a prominent role in delicate tasks where classic robots fail, such as in minimally invasive surgery, active prosthetics, and automation tasks involving delicate irregular objects. Central to the development of these robots is the fabrication of soft actuators. This article reviews a particularly attractive type of soft actuators that are driven by pressurized fluids. These actuators have recently gained traction on the one hand due to the technology push from better simulation tools and new manufacturing technologies, and on the other hand by a market pull from applications. This paper provides an overview of the different advanced soft actuator configurations, their design, fabrication, and applications.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, robot manipulators have been a simple arrangement of a small number of serially connected links and actuated joints. Though these manipulators prove to be very effective for many tasks, they are not without their limitations, due mainly to their lack of maneuverability or total degrees of freedom. Continuum style (i.e., continuous "back-bone") robots, on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of maneuverability, and can have a large number of degrees of freedom. The motion of continuum style robots is generated through the bending of the robot over a given section; unlike traditional robots where the motion occurs in discrete locations, i.e., joints. The motion of continuum manipulators is often compared to that of biological manipulators such as trunks and tentacles. These continuum style robots can achieve motions that could only be obtainable by a conventionally designed robot with many more degrees of freedom. In this paper we present a detailed formulation and explanation of a novel kinematic model for continuum style robots. The design, construction, and implementation of our continuum style robot called the elephant trunk manipulator is presented. Experimental results are then provided to verify the legitimacy of our model when applied to our physical manipulator. We also provide a set of obstacle avoidance experiments that help to exhibit the practical implementation of both our manipulator and our kinematic model.},

  abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are widely studied and applied in the field of soft robotics. To expand their applications, the SPAs should be purpose-built to generate application-specific complex motions with multiple degrees of freedom. This article describes a new SPA consisting of a series of internal chambers with the same helix angle arranged in a row, which could generate bending and twisting motions simultaneously. The trajectory of the helical actuator was analyzed through the finite element method (FEM) by changing the angle of the chambers and the actuator length. We employed a three-dimensional printing method to directly fabricate the thin-walled and airtight helical actuators without applying any postfabrication process. The recorded trajectory of the actuator and the measured blocking force on the tipping point were compared with the corresponding simulation results from the FEM. The actuation behavior of the helical actuator has been compared with that of the actuator with zero chamber angle, but with the same size (i.e., a normal bending actuator generating a two-dimensional trajectory). It is found that the proposed helical actuator (with a maximum 2.10 N blocking force) had a higher mechanical output (or efficiency) than the normal bending actuator (with a maximum 1.19 N blocking force) under the same pressure input. We fabricated a soft helical actuator as the fingers of a four-finger gripper to grasp complex-shaped items. Furthermore, another four-finger gripper made of a hybrid actuator consisting of a half of the angled chambers and a half of the nonangled chambers was constructed to demonstrate that the proposed design and fabrication technique could be employed to establish application- and function-specific soft robotic systems.},

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus (< 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials & fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

In this work, the use of free-sliding SMA wires as tendons for soft actuation is presented that enables large increases in the bending angle and bending force of the actuator by decoupling the length of the matrix and the length of the SMA wires while also allowing for the compact packaging of the driving SMA wires. Bending angles of 400° and tip forces of 0.89 N were achieved by the actuators in this work using a tendon length up to 350 mm. The tendons were integrated as a compact module using bearings that enables the actuator to easily be implemented in various soft gripper configurations. Three fingers were used either in an antagonistic configuration or in a triangular configuration and the gripper was shown to be capable of gripping a wide range of objects weighing up to 1.5 kg and was easily installed on a robotic arm. The maximum pulling force of the gripper was measured to be 30 N.},

  abstract = {The stability properties of a freely rotating rigid body are governed by the intermediate axis theorem, i.e., rotation around the major and minor principal axes is stable whereas rotation around the intermediate axis is unstable. The stability of the principal axes is of importance for the prediction of rockfall. Current numerical schemes for 3D rockfall simulation, however, are not able to correctly represent these stability properties. In this paper an extended intermediate axis theorem is presented, which not only involves the angular momentum equations but also the orientation of the body, and we prove the theorem using Lyapunov’s direct method. Based on the stability proof, we present a novel scheme which respects the stability properties of a freely rotating body and which can be incorporated in numerical schemes for the simulation of rigid bodies with frictional unilateral constraints. In particular, we show how this scheme is incorporated in an existing 3D rockfall simulation code. Simulations results reveal that the stability properties of rotating rocks play an essential role in the run-out length and lateral spreading of rocks.},

We detail the design, modeling, fabrication, and control of the soft fish, focusing on enabling the robot to perform rapid escape responses. The robot employs a compliant body with embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition, the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing, and control. At the core of the fish's soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained robot. The kinematics and controllability of the robot during simulated escape response maneuvers are analyzed and compared with studies on biological fish. We show that during escape responses, the soft-bodied robot has similar input–output relationships to those observed in biological fish. The major implication of this work is that we show soft robots can be both self-contained and capable of rapid body motion.},

These systems bring man-made machines closer to the natural capabilities of biological systems. An important requirement to enable self-contained soft mobile robots is an on-board power source. In this paper, we present an approach to create a bio-inspired soft robotic snake that can undulate in a similar way to its biological counterpart using pressure for actuation power, without human intervention. With this approach, we develop an autonomous soft snake robot with on-board actuation, power, computation and control capabilities. The robot consists of four bidirectional fluidic elastomer actuators in series to create a traveling curvature wave from head to tail along its body. Passive wheels between segments generate the necessary frictional anisotropy for forward locomotion. It takes 14 h to build the soft robotic snake, which can attain an average locomotion speed of 19 mm s−1.},

  abstract = {The dynamic equations of many continuum and soft robot designs can be succinctly formulated as a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) based on classical Cosserat rod theory, which includes bending, torsion, shear, and extension. In this work we present a numerical approach for forward dynamics simulation of Cosserat-based robot models in real time. The approach implicitly discretizes the time derivatives in the PDEs and then solves the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) boundary value problem (BVP) in arc length at each timestep. We show that this strategy can encompass a wide variety of robot models and numerical schemes in both time and space, with minimal symbolic manipulation required. Computational efficiency is gained owing to the stability of implicit methods at large timesteps, and implementation is relatively simple, which we demonstrate by providing a short MATLAB-coded example. We investigate and quantify the tradeoffs associated with several numerical subroutines, and we validate accuracy compared with dynamic rod data gathered with a high-speed camera system. To demonstrate the method’s application to continuum and soft robots, we derive several Cosserat-based dynamic models for robots using various actuation schemes (extensible rods, tendons, and fluidic chambers) and apply our approach to achieve real-time simulation in each case, with additional experimental validation on a tendon robot. Results show that these models capture several important phenomena, such as stability transitions and the effect of a compressible working fluid.},

For example, conventional robot manipulators have rigid links and can manipulate objects using only their specialised end effectors. These robots often encounter difficulties operating in unstructured and highly congested environments. A variety of animals and plants exhibit complex movement with soft structures devoid of rigid components. Muscular hydrostats (e.g. octopus arms and elephant trunks) are almost entirely composed of muscle and connective tissue and plant cells can change shape when pressurised by osmosis. Researchers have been inspired by biology to design and build soft robots. With a soft structure and redundant degrees of freedom, these robots can be used for delicate tasks in cluttered and/or unstructured environments. This paper discusses the novel capabilities of soft robots, describes examples from nature that provide biological inspiration, surveys the state of the art and outlines existing challenges in soft robot design, modelling, fabrication and control.},

  abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot’s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

The strong nonlinearities and complex geometries of soft actuators hinder the development of analytical models to describe their motion. Finite element modeling provides an effective solution to this issue and allows the user to predict performance and optimize soft actuator designs. Herein, the literature on a finite element analysis of soft actuators is reviewed. First, the required nonlinear elasticity concepts are introduced with a focus on the relevant models for soft robotics. In particular, the procedure for determining material constants for the hyperelastic models from material testing and curve fitting is explored. Then, a comprehensive review of constitutive model parameters for the most widely used silicone rubbers in the literature is provided. An overview of the procedure is provided for three commercially available software packages (Abaqus, Ansys, and COMSOL). The combination of modeling procedures, material properties, and design guidelines presented in this article can be used as a starting point for soft robotic actuator design.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the benefits of using multiple gaits in a single robot. Inspired by nature, where humans and animals use different gaits to increase their energetic economy, we analyzed how increasing speed affects the choice of gait, and how the choice of gait influences optimal speed. To this end, we used optimal control as a tool to identify motions that minimize the cost of transport of two detailed models: a planar biped and a planar quadruped. Both of these models are actuated with high compliance series elastic actuators that enable a rich set of natural dynamics. These models have damping in their springs, feet with mass, and realistic limitations on actuator torques and velocities. They therefore serve as an intermediary between past simpler models and hardware. We discovered optimal motions with an established multiple shooting implementation that relies on pre-defined contact sequences, and with a direct collocation implementation in which the footfall pattern was an outcome of the optimization. Both algorithms confirmed findings from biology. For both models, changing gaits as speed varies leads to greatly increased energetic economy. For bipeds, the optimal gaits were walking at low speeds, grounded running at intermediate speeds, and running at high speeds. For quadrupeds, the optimal gaits were four-beat walking at low speeds and trotting at intermediate speeds. At high speeds, galloping and trotting were the best gaits, with nearly equal performance. We found that the transition between gaits was primarily driven by damping losses and negative actuator work, with collisions playing a relatively small role.},

We compare two model instances of a conceptual planar quadruped: one with a traditional rigid main body and one with an articulated main body with an actuated spinal joint. Both models feature four distinct legs, series elastic actuation, distributed mass in all body segments, and limits on actuator torque and speed. Using optimal control to find the energetically optimal joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and footfall timing, we examine and compare the positive mechanical work cost of transport of both models across multiple gaits and speeds. Our results show that an articulated spine increases the maximum possible speed and improves the locomotor economy at higher velocities, especially for asymmetrical gaits. The driving factors for these improvements are the same mechanistic effects that facilitate asymmetrical gaits in nature: improved leg recirculation, elastic energy storage in the spine, and enlarged stride lengths.},

To this end, we compare and contrast the two actuation concepts in energy optimal hopping motions. To enable a fair comparison, we employ optimal control to identify motion trajectories, actuator inputs, and system parameters that are optimally suited for each actuator concept. In other words, we compare the best possible hopper with parallel elastic actuation to the best possible hopper with series elastic actuation. The optimizations are conducted for three different cost functions: positive mechanical motor work, thermal electrical losses, and positive electrical work. Furthermore, we look at three representative cases for converting rotary motor motion to linear leg motion in a legged robot. Our model featured an electric DC-motor model, a gearbox with friction, damping in the leg spring, and contact collisions. We find that the optimal actuator choice depends both on the cost function and conversion of motor motion to leg motion. When considering only thermal electrical losses, parallel elastic actuation always performs better. In terms of positive mechanical motor work and positive electrical work, series elastic actuation is better when there is little friction in the gear-train. For higher gear-train friction parallel elastic actuation is more economical for these cost functions as well.}},

  abstract  = {Conventional industrial robots with the rigid actuation technology have made great progress for humans in the fields of automation assembly and manufacturing. With an increasing number of robots needing to interact with humans and unstructured environments, there is a need for soft robots capable of sustaining large deformation while inducing little pressure or damage when maneuvering through confined spaces. The emergence of soft robotics offers the prospect of applying soft actuators as artificial muscles in robots, replacing traditional rigid actuators. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are recognized as one of the most promising soft actuation technologies due to the facts that: i) dielectric elastomers are kind of soft, motion-generating materials that resemble natural muscle of humans in terms of force, strain (displacement per unit length or area) and actuation pressure/density; ii) dielectric elastomers can produce large voltage-induced deformation. In this survey, we first introduce the so-called DEAs emphasizing the key points of working principle, key components and electromechanical modeling approaches. Then, different DEA-driven soft robots, including wearable/humanoid robots, walking/serpentine robots, flying robots and swimming robots, are reviewed. Lastly, we summarize the challenges and opportunities for the further studies in terms of mechanism design, dynamics modeling and autonomous control.},

The SMS can modular assemble soft robots with multiple morphologies such as lateral robots, bilateral robots and actinomorphic robots. A five-armed actinomorphic soft robot is conducted to crawling in terrestrial ground (max speed: 140 mm s−1, 0.7 body s−1), swimming in underwater environment (max speed: 67 mm s−1, 2.5 height s−1) and griping fragile objects (max object weight: 0.91 kg, 15 times the weight of itself).
